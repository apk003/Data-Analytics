## Overview
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate program.

It is a quick data cleaning task in a spreadsheet, though writing a quick Spark script would work just as well.


## Scenario
Suppose you are a data analyst for a public school district in Portugal.

First, sort by school in ascending order followed by age in descending order. Then, filter and delete students over age 19. Lastly, fill in missing data and convert measurable qualities into discrete values.
