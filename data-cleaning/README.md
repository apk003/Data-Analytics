## Overview
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate program.

It is a quick data cleaning task in a spreadsheet, though writing a quick Spark script would work just as well.


## Scenario
Suppose you are a data analyst for a public school district in Portugal.

Sort, filter, impute missing values, and transform the data into a standardized format.

## Files
student-performance-data.csv - raw spreadsheet data exported to csv

student-performance-cleaned.csv - cleaned dataset
