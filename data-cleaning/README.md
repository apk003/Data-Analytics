## Overview
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate program. Scenarios are mine, but inspired by the program.

Scenario 1 is a quick data cleaning task in a spreadsheet, though writing a quick Spark script would work just as well.

Scenario 2 is a slightly more in-depth data cleaning task using industry best practices.


## Scenario 1
Suppose you are a data analyst for a public school district in Portugal.

First, sort by school in ascending order followed by age in descending order. Then, filter and delete students over age 19. Lastly, fill in missing data and convert measurable qualities into discrete values.

## Scenario 2
You are a newly-hired data analyst for a furniture store and need to get familiar with the dataset. Run some SQL queries to find out naming schema, become familiar with prices, and compare couches.
