It is a simple introduction to SQL fully within the Google Cloud Platform, additionally building skills with virtual machines and BigQuery.


## Scenario
Suppose you are a data analyst at a company that is looking to expand. However, they are unsure where to expand to, so they want you to run some analysis. Data on various cities has been collected, cleaned, and structured nicely in world_cities.csv. Next, create a table of all cities with average temperature between 45 and 65, commute time less than 60 minutes, and among the top 15 in happiness ranking.

The resulting table has only two entries: Dublin and Toronto. Though they are excellent choices, you decide to allow up to 20 happiness ranking in order to select 4 total cities. The cities in candidate_cities.csv are the ones you will bring to the next meeting.
